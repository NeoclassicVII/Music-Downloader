# Music-Downloader
YouTube Music Downloader for Metalheads by Neoclassic VII!

You can change the code, if you want. For what? Well, this program supports only metal music, but you can easily change that by changing the code. So, if you want to download for example rap music, you can do that by changing the code (it's really easy to do, trust me)!

# How does the script work? 

In simple terms, the script simply downloads songs from YouTube in mp3 format. But if it were just a script that searches for your request on YouTube and downloads the desired video in mp3 format - then situations like this could arise: 

The user has not entered a musical request. That means, if the user entered something like "Minecraft tutorial", the script will download video on this request in mp3 format. This means that the script would download any of your requests, as it simply searches for your request on YouTube and downloads the video in mp3 format. 

To avoid such situations, this script first searches your request on LastFM platform to maximize the chance of downloading songs and not other requests. In other words, the script first filters the request through LastFM, and then, if the script found the song on LastFM, it searches for the same request on YouTube. This way only songs are downloaded and not other requests like "Minecraft tutorial". 

But since LastFM is full of non-music content (e.g. Python tutorial etc.), the script looks for "certain tags" to avoid downloading such non-music content. That is, the script filters content by tags/genres. This means that a user can easily download songs of ONE genre if he/she wants. There is a tag/genre list in the script for this purpose. The user can change this list by adding the tags/genres they want. The important thing is that these tags exist on LastFM.

# How to download songs of other genres?

There's a list in the code called "genres". You can add tags to that list to download songs in other genres. Important: The tags must exist on LastFM. 

# How exactly do I change the list? 

As the script works directly with LastFM, you will need to follow some "rules". First, you need to know what tags exist on LastFM specifically for your genre. That means, you need to know what tags on LastFM you need. If you know it, just add those tags to the list so the program can work with them. If you don't know, however, it's very easy to find out. Let's say you want to download songs in the rap genre. To do this, you need to find the appropriate tags for that genre on LastFM. 

For example: 
- rap
- hip-hop
- gangsta rap
- mumble rap
etc.

All of these tags are on LastFM, it's important. Just search on LastFM for the tags you want, check, if they exist and if there are songs with those tags and then add them to the list of genres/tags.
